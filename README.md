## Installation

To locally run the project...

1. Create a database named `basic_golf_score_tracker`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate those tables with some sample feedack.

Using Postico is recommended to run those queries as that was used to create the queries
